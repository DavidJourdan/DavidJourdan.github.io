I'm using a modified version of a theme created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) that you can access [here](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/resume/), so thank you Start Bootstrap for providing this theme !

I also used a bit of [three.js](threejs.org) on the front page to display a [Clebsch surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clebsch_surface), an object I once studied in an algebraic geometry class, a both interesting and beautiful object.
